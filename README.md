# Sliding Puzzle (Taquin Puzzle)

This project is an implementation of a classic 3x3 sliding puzzle (also known as the "Taquin" or "15 Puzzle"). The puzzle is solved using depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms. Users can interact with the puzzle via a GUI built using `Tkinter`, where they can shuffle the puzzle, manually solve it, or allow the program to solve it using one of the algorithms.

## Features
- Shuffle the puzzle to generate random configurations.
- Solve the puzzle using DFS or BFS algorithms.
- Real-time puzzle solving animations for both algorithms.
- Reset button to restore the puzzle to its initial state.
- A user-friendly graphical interface.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- `Pillow` (Python Imaging Library Fork)
  - Install via `pip install pillow`
